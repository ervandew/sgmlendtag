This sgml end tag completion plugin aims to provide a simple means to complete
end tags in sgml documents (xml, html, etc.). Unlike some other end tag
completion plugins, the end tag is not auto added when you finish typing the
opening tag, but instead is inserted only when you start typing the closing tag
(when you hit the slash in '</'), at which point the tag name and closing > are
inserted automatically.

The intent of this approach is to prevent an interruption in your flow of
typing by not requiring you to ever have to navigate around text added to the
right of the cursor.
